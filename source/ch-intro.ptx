    <introduction>
      <p>
        The purpose of this pamphlet is to expose incoming trigonometry students 
        to a few concepts from classical geometry, many of whom have never taken a course in 
        Geometry in High School.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a few goals: 
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
                show inspiring geometric proofs; 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                explain the difference between geometry and trigonometry; 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                introduce optimization theory.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
