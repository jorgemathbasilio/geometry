    <title>The First Theorems</title>

<p>
    What were the first theorems developed in antiquity? 
    While it is difficult to say for sure, one is likely the following result attributed to Thales:
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-thales1">
    <statement>
        <p>
            A diameter cuts a circle into two equal parts.
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>



<figure xml:id="fig-thales1">
  <caption>Thales diameter theorem.</caption>
  <image width="50%" xml:id="thales1">

  <latex-image>
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \coordinate [label=left:\textcolor{blue}{$A$}]  (A) at (0,0);
  \coordinate [label=right:\textcolor{blue}{$B$}] (B) at (3,0);
  \coordinate (C) at (1.5,0);

  %line
  \draw[blue] (A) -- (B);

  % circle
  \draw[blue] (C) circle (1.5);
  \end{tikzpicture}   
  </latex-image>
  </image>
</figure>

<p>
    Not very exiting, right? 
    Well, it is not really the result that is so important but the realization that it can be proven using an argument. 
    This realization  must have been a real <q>aha</q> moment.
