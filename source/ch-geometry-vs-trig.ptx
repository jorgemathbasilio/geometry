    <title>Geometry Versus Trigonometry</title>

<p>
    Let's start with the etymology of the terms: 
</p>    

<blockquote>
  <title>Geometry</title>
  <p>
      <term>geometry</term> comes from the Greek word, <m>\gamma \epsilon \omega \mu \epsilon \tau \iota \alpha</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    (<m>\gamma \epsilon \omega</m> = <q>geo</q> = Earth) <m>+</m> (<m>\mu \epsilon \tau \iota \alpha</m> = <q>metria</q> = to measure)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    and
</p>

<blockquote>
  <title>Trigonometry</title>
  <p>
      <term>trigonometry</term> comes from the Greek word, <m>\tau \rho \iota \gamma \omega \nu o \mu \epsilon \tau \iota \alpha</m>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    (<m>\tau \rho \iota \gamma \omega \nu o</m> = <q>trigono</q> = triangle) <m>+</m> (<m>\mu \epsilon \tau \iota \alpha</m> = <q>metria</q> = to measure)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
   These terms suggest that geometry stemmed from observations from building and constructing land plots, homes, tools, etc. 
   The objects that evidently present themselves are points (locations), lines (stretched ropes), circles and triangles. 
   <term>Euclidean geometry</term> abstracts these objects (definitions, axioms, etc. see below) and 
   provides a mathematical theory about these objects using the principles of logical deduction.  
</p>

<p>
    Trigonometry also concerns the study of triangles and circles so what's difference? 
    In short, numbers and algebra! Essentially, trigonometry is the theory of geometry using algebraic techniques, 
    which includes a deep understanding of number (the real numbers) and measurement.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at a few problems from each field of study and compare and contrast.
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A geometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            A triangle has side lengths 10, 10, and 10 <taxon>Jorgemeters</taxon><fn>A Jorgemeter is a madeup unit of measuring length. A foot or meter or any other unit of length would do here.</fn> 
            What are the angles?
        </p>
    </statement>
</exercise>

<p>
    This can be solve with pure Euclidean geometry without measuring the angles. 
    This can be done using pure geometry for only a few special triangles.
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A trigonometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            A triangle has side lengths 5, 6, and 7 <taxon>Jorgemeters</taxon>. 
            What are the angles?
        </p>
    </statement>
</exercise>

<p>
    This cannot be solved using Euclidean Geometry and the best we could do would be to construct such a triangle and measure 
    the angles using a protractor. To arrive at an exact answer requires new ideas which we will learn in trigonometry. 
</p>

<p>
    Next, consider:
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A geometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            In a triangle two sides have lengths 3 and 4 <taxon>Jorgemeters</taxon> and the angle between them is a right angle. 
            What is the length of the third side?
        </p>
    </statement>
</exercise>

<p>
    This can be solved using the Pythagorean Theorem.
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A trigonometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            In the same situation as Problem 3, what are the other two angles?
        </p>
    </statement>
</exercise>

<p>
    We cannot find the angles using geometry. 
</p>

<p>
    We turn to a few problems on circles. 
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A geometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            In a certain circle, a central angle of <m>15^{\circ}</m> cuts off an <term>arc</term> that is 10 <em>Jorgemeters</em> long. 
            In the same circle, what is the length of the arc cut off by a central angle of <m>30^{\circ}</m>?
        </p>
    </statement>

    <p>
        ADD figure.
    </p>
</exercise>

<p>
    This is easily solved because the arc length is additive. Whereas:
</p>

<exercise>
  <title>A trigonometry problem</title>

    <statement>
        <p>
            In a certain circle, a central angle of <m>15^{\circ}</m> cuts off a <term>chord</term> that is 8 <em>Jorgemeters</em> long. 
            In the same circle, what is the length of the chord cut off by a central angle of <m>30^{\circ}</m>?
        </p>
    </statement>

    <p>
        ADD figure.
    </p>
</exercise>

<p>
    This cannot be easily solved because it is not simply twice the length as before. I
    n fact, see if you can argue why the chord of central angle <m>30^{\circ}</m> is actually less than twice as long as 
    the chord of central angle <m>15^{\circ}</m>.
