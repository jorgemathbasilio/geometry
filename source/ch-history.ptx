        Geometry grew out of observations made by ancient builders.

        I believe that humans love order and abstraction. 
        You might disagree, but the fact that you know how to count 1, 2, 3, etc., 
        without having one banana, two bananas, etc., shows that you at least find it's value. 
        Abstraction makes the world easier and transforms difficult problems into more tractable ones. That is, abstraction simplifies the complicated mess of reality and let us one focus on a few properties at a time. Abstraction is certainly useful, but if it wasn't at least a bit of fun then I doubt it would have been this long-lasting, ubiquitous, and have so many practitioners (i.e. mathematicians).
