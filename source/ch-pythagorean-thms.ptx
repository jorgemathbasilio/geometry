  Given the above quote, it seems only natural to start with The Pythagorean Theorem; 
  a result about right triangles.

<p>
  What is a triangle? A <term>triangle</term> is a planar figure formed by joining three straight lines, say, of lengths, <m>a, b, c</m>.

  What is an angle? We will address this more fully shortly. 
  For now, let's assume you know what an angle is and, specifically, 
  a right-angle: one-half a straight angle (or, 1/4 of a full rotation).
</p>

<p>
  The Pythagorean Theorem is stated and proved in the last two propositions (a.k.a. theorems) of Book I of Euclid's <pubtitle>Elements</pubtitle>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-pythag-47">
    <title>Pythagorean Theorem (Euclid Book I, Proposition 47)</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle. 
    </p>
  </statement>

  To the ancient geometers this was a statement about areas. 
  But in modern times, this has now become an algebraic statement. 
  In modern notation, this says, if <m>a, b, c</m> are the side lengths of a right triangle with <m>c</m> along the hypotenuse, 
  then <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.
</p>

<p>
  But, wait! There's more!
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-pythag-48">
    <title>Pythagorean Theorem (Euclid Book I, Proposition 48)</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, 
      then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.
    </p>
  </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
  Although these may look identical, a careful reading shows they are indeed different statements. 
  In fact, they are <em>converses</em> of each other.
</p>

<p>
  <xref ref="thm-pythag-47" /> says that if we know something about one of the angles in a triangle (that one is a right angle), 
  then we can conclude a special relationship must hold about its side lengths. 
</p>

<p>
  <xref ref="thm-pythag-48" /> says that if we know the side lengths of a triangle satisfy a special equation, 
  then we can conclude something about one of its angles (one must be a right angle). 
</p>

<p>
  Over 300 proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem exist. 
  So, why not see if you can come up with your own proof! I'll provide a few of my favorite proofs later.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to read the proof given in Euclid, 
  I recommend that you jump straight into Proposition 48. 
  Then read proposition 47, then 46, etc. Reading Euclid backwards, so-to-speak. 
  This can be much more illuminating because you will understand why you need each previous result and you reduce it back to the definitions and axioms.
